  This is test-name's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
  most important story about it. Keep it under 100 words though,
  we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the
  container registries out there.
# the platforms this rock should be built on and run on.
# you can check your architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`
platforms:
  amd64:
  # arm64:
  # ppc64el:

# to ensure the flask-framework extension works properly, your Flask application
# should have an `app.py` file with an `app` object as the WSGI entrypoint.
# a `requirements.txt` file with at least the flask package should also exist.
# see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/latest/reference/extensions/flask-framework
# for more information.

#       # by default, only the files in app/, templates/, static/, migrate, migrate.sh,
#       # migrate.py and app.py are copied into the image. You can modify the list
#       # below to override the default list and include or exclude specific
#       # files/directories in your project.
#       # note: prefix each entry with "flask/app/" followed by the local path.

# you may need Ubuntu packages to build a python dependency. Add them here if necessary.
#   flask-framework/dependencies:
#     build-packages:
#       # for example, if you need pkg-config and libxmlsec1-dev to build one
#       # of your packages:
#       - pkg-config
#       - libxmlsec1-dev

# you can add package slices or Debian packages to the image.
# package slices are subsets of Debian packages, which result
# in smaller and more secure images.
# see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/latest/explanation/chisel/

# add this part if you want to add packages slices to your image.
# you can find a list of packages slices at https://github.com/canonical/chisel-releases
#   runtime-slices:
#     plugin: nil
#     stage-packages:
#       # list the required package slices for your flask application below.
#       # for example, for the slice libs of libpq5:
#       - libpq5_libs

# if you want to add a Debian package to your image, add the next part
#   runtime-debs:
#     plugin: nil
#     stage-packages:
#       # list required Debian packages for your flask application below.
#       - libpq5
