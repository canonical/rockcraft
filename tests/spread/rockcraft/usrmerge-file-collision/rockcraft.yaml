    # Both overlay-packages and stage-packages include `libexpat1`, so because
    # of the usrmerge in the ubuntu-based overlay we will have many file-based
    # conflicts; for instance, both lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libexpat.so.1 _and_
    # usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libexpat.so.1 will be created, one coming from the
    # overlay-package and one from the stage-package.
