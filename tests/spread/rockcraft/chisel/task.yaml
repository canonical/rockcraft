summary: a test that checks rocks created with Chisel slices

execute: |
  run_rockcraft pack

  ROCK=$(ls ./*.rock)
  IMG_NAME=chiseled-base-files

  test -f "$ROCK"

  # copy image to docker
  docker images
  sudo rockcraft.skopeo --insecure-policy copy "oci-archive:$ROCK" "docker-daemon:$IMG_NAME:latest"
  rm "$ROCK"

  # Check that the file "md5sum" exists in "/bin". This file is provided
  # by the "coreutils_bins" slice as "/usr/bin/lmd5sum", so this check will
  # only succeed if:
  #   * the "/bin -> usr/bin" symlink is correct, and;
  #   * pebble itself is found and working correctly (for the exec call).
  docker run --rm $IMG_NAME -v exec test -f /bin/md5sum
