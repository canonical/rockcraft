  # Check that the file "md5sum" exists in "/bin". This file is provided
  # by the "coreutils_bins" slice as "/usr/bin/lmd5sum", so this check will
  # only succeed if:
  #   * the "/bin -> usr/bin" symlink is correct, and;
  #   * pebble itself is found and working correctly (for the exec call).
  docker run --rm $IMG_NAME exec test -f /bin/md5sum
