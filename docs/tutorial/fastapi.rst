Build a rock for a FastAPI app
------------------------------

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple FastAPI app and learn how to
containerise it in a rock with Rockcraft's
:ref:`fastapi-framework <fastapi-framework-reference>` extension.

Setup
=====

.. include:: /reuse/tutorial/setup_edge.rst

Finally, create an empty project directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir fastapi-hello-world
   cd fastapi-hello-world

Create the FastAPI app
======================

Let's start by creating the "Hello, world" FastAPI app that we'll use
throughout this tutorial.

Create a ``requirements.txt`` file, copy the following text into it, and then
save it:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/requirements.txt
    :caption: ~/fastapi-hello-world/requirements.txt

It's fastest to test the FastAPI app locally, before we pack it into a
rock, so let's install ``python3-venv`` and create a virtual environment we
can work in:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:create-venv]
    :end-before: [docs:create-venv-end]
    :dedent: 2

In the same directory, put the following code into a new file,
``app.py``:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/app.py
    :caption: ~/fastapi-hello-world/app.py
    :language: python

Run the FastAPI app using ``fastapi dev app.py --port 8000`` to verify
that it works.

Test the FastAPI app by using ``curl`` to send a request to the root
endpoint. We'll need a new terminal for this -- run
``multipass shell rock-dev`` to get another terminal:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:curl-fastapi]
    :end-before: [docs:curl-fastapi-end]
    :dedent: 2

The FastAPI app should respond with ``{"message":"Hello World"}``.

The app looks good, so let's stop it for now by pressing :kbd:`Ctrl` +
:kbd:`C`.

Pack the FastAPI app into a rock
================================

Now let's create a container image for our FastAPI app. We'll use a rock,
which is an OCI-compliant container image based on Ubuntu.

First, we'll need a ``rockcraft.yaml`` project file. We'll take advantage of a
pre-defined extension in Rockcraft with the ``--profile`` flag that caters
initial rock files for specific web app frameworks. Using the
FastAPI profile, Rockcraft automates the creation of
``rockcraft.yaml`` and tailors the file for a FastAPI app.
From the ``~/fastapi-hello-world`` directory, initialize the rock:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:create-rockcraft-yaml]
    :end-before: [docs:create-rockcraft-yaml-end]
    :dedent: 2

The project file will automatically be created in the project's working
directory as ``rockcraft.yaml``.

Check out the contents of ``rockcraft.yaml``:

.. code-block:: bash

    cat rockcraft.yaml

The top of the file should look similar to the following snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: ~/fastapi-hello-world/rockcraft.yaml

    name: fastapi-hello-world
    # see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/latest/explanation/bases/
    # for more information about bases and using 'bare' bases for chiselled rocks
    base: ubuntu@24.04 # the base environment for this FastAPI app
    version: '0.1' # just for humans. Semantic versioning is recommended
    summary: A summary of your FastAPI app # 79 char long summary
    description: |
        This is fastapi project's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
        most important story about it. Keep it under 100 words though,
        we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the
        container registries out there.
    # the platforms this rock should be built on and run on.
    # you can check your architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`
    platforms:
        amd64:
        # arm64:
        # ppc64el:
        # s390x:

Verify that the ``name`` is ``fastapi-hello-world``.

The ``platforms`` key must match the architecture of your host. Check
the architecture of your system:

.. code-block:: bash

    dpkg --print-architecture

Edit the ``platforms`` key in ``rockcraft.yaml`` if required.

.. note::
    For this tutorial, we'll use the ``name`` ``fastapi-hello-world`` and assume
    we're running on the  ``amd64`` platform. Check the architecture of the
    system using ``dpkg --print-architecture``.

    The ``name``, ``version`` and ``platform`` all influence the name of the
    generated ``.rock`` file.

As the ``fastapi-framework`` extension is still experimental, export the
environment variable ``ROCKCRAFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXTENSIONS``:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:experimental]
    :end-before: [docs:experimental-end]
    :dedent: 2

Pack the rock:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:pack]
    :end-before: [docs:pack-end]
    :dedent: 2

.. warning::
   There is a `known connectivity issue with LXD and Docker
   <lxd-docker-connectivity-issue_>`_. If we see a
   networking issue such as "*A network related operation failed in a context
   of no network access*" or ``Client.Timeout``, allow egress network traffic
   to flow from the LXD managed bridge using:

   .. code-block::

       iptables  -I DOCKER-USER -i <network_bridge> -j ACCEPT
       ip6tables -I DOCKER-USER -i <network_bridge> -j ACCEPT
       iptables  -I DOCKER-USER -o <network_bridge> -m conntrack \
         --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
       ip6tables -I DOCKER-USER -o <network_bridge> -m conntrack \
         --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

   Run ``lxc network list`` to show the existing LXD managed bridges.

Depending on the network, this step can take a couple of minutes to finish.
Since FastAPI is an experimental extension,
``ROCKCRAFT_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_EXTENSIONS`` must be enabled.

Once Rockcraft has finished packing the FastAPI rock, we'll find a new file in
the project's working directory (an `OCI <OCI_image_spec_>`_ archive) with
the ``.rock`` extension:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:ls-rock]
    :end-before: [docs:ls-rock-end]
    :dedent: 2

The created rock is about 75MB in size. We will reduce its size later in this
tutorial.

.. note::
    If we changed the ``name`` or ``version`` in the project file or are not
    on an ``amd64`` platform, the name of the ``.rock`` file will be
    different.

    The size of the rock may vary depending on factors like the architecture
    we are building on and the packages installed at the time of packing.

Run the FastAPI rock with Docker
================================

We already have the rock as an `OCI <OCI_image_spec_>`_ archive. Now we
need to load it into Docker. Docker requires rocks to be imported into the
daemon since they can't be run directly like an executable.

Copy the rock:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:skopeo-copy]
    :end-before: [docs:skopeo-copy-end]
    :dedent: 2

This command contains the following pieces:

- ``--insecure-policy``: adopts a permissive policy that
  removes the need for a dedicated policy file.
- ``oci-archive``: specifies the rock we created for our FastAPI app.
- ``docker-daemon``: specifies the name of the image in the Docker registry.

Check that the image was successfully loaded into Docker:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:docker-images]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-images-end]
    :dedent: 2

The output should list the FastAPI container image, along with its tag, ID and
size:

.. terminal::

    REPOSITORY            TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
    fastapi-hello-world   0.1       30c7e5aed202   2 weeks ago   193MB

.. note::
    The size of the image reported by Docker is the uncompressed size which is
    larger than the size of the compressed ``.rock`` file.

Now we're finally ready to run the rock and test the containerised FastAPI
app:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:docker-run]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-run-end]
    :dedent: 2

Use the same ``curl`` command as before to send a request to the FastAPI
app's root endpoint which is running inside the container:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:curl-fastapi-rock]
    :end-before: [docs:curl-fastapi-rock-end]
    :dedent: 2

The FastAPI app should again respond with ``{"message":"Hello World"}``.

View the app logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When deploying the FastAPI rock, we can always get the app logs via
:ref:`pebble_explanation_page`:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:get-logs]
    :end-before: [docs:get-logs-end]
    :dedent: 2

As a result, Pebble will give us the logs for the
``fastapi`` service running inside the container.
We should expect to see something similar to this:

.. terminal::

    2024-10-01T06:32:50.180Z [fastapi] INFO:     Started server process [12]
    2024-10-01T06:32:50.181Z [fastapi] INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
    2024-10-01T06:32:50.181Z [fastapi] INFO:     Application startup complete.
    2024-10-01T06:32:50.182Z [fastapi] INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
    2024-10-01T06:32:58.214Z [fastapi] INFO:     172.17.0.1:55232 - "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 OK

We can also choose to follow the logs by using the ``-f`` option with the
``pebble logs`` command above. To stop following the logs, press :kbd:`Ctrl` +
:kbd:`C`.

Cleanup
~~~~~~~

Now we have a fully functional rock for a FastAPI app! This concludes
the first part of this tutorial, so we'll stop the container and remove the
respective image for now:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:stop-docker]
    :end-before: [docs:stop-docker-end]
    :dedent: 2

Chisel the rock
===============

This is an optional but recommended step, especially if we're looking to
deploy the rock into a production environment. With :ref:`chisel_explanation`
we can produce lean and production-ready rocks by getting rid of all the
contents that are not needed for the FastAPI app to run. This results
in a much smaller rock with a reduced attack surface.

.. note::
    It is recommended to run chiselled images in production. For development,
    we may prefer non-chiselled images as they will include additional
    development tooling (such as for debugging).

The first step towards chiselling the rock is to ensure we are using a
``bare`` :ref:`base <explanation-bases>`.
In the project file, change the ``base`` to ``bare`` and add
``build-base: ubuntu@24.04``:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: git diff

        .. code-block:: diff

            name: fastapi-rock
            -base: ubuntu@24.04
            +base: bare
            +build-base: ubuntu@24.04
            version: '0.1'
            summary: A summary of your FastAPI application
            description: |

    .. tab:: sed command

        .. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
            :language: bash
            :start-after: [docs:change-base]
            :end-before: [docs:change-base-end]
            :dedent: 2

So that we can compare the size after chiselling, open the project
file and change the ``version`` (e.g. to ``0.1-chiselled``).
The top of the ``rockcraft.yaml`` file should look similar to the following:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: ~/fastapi-hello-world/rockcraft.yaml
    :emphasize-lines: 6

    name: fastapi-hello-world
    # see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/latest/explanation/bases/
    # for more information about bases and using 'bare' bases for chiselled rocks
    base: bare
    build-base: ubuntu@24.04
    version: '0.1-chiselled'
    summary: A summary of your FastAPI app # 79 char long summary
    description: |
        This is fastapi project's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
        most important story about it. Keep it under 100 words though,
        we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the
        container registries out there.
    # the platforms this rock should be built on and run on.
    # you can check your architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`
    platforms:
        amd64:
        # arm64:
        # ppc64el:
        # s390x:

Pack the rock with the new ``bare`` base:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:chisel-pack]
    :end-before: [docs:chisel-pack-end]
    :dedent: 2

As before, verify that the new rock was created:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:ls-bare-rock]
    :end-before: [docs:ls-bare-rock-end]
    :dedent: 2

We'll verify that the new FastAPI rock is now approximately **35% smaller**
in size! And that's just because of the simple change of ``base``.

And the functionality is still the same. As before, we can confirm this by
running the rock with Docker

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:docker-run-chisel]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-run-chisel-end]
    :dedent: 2

and then using the same ``curl`` request:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:curl-fastapi-bare-rock]
    :end-before: [docs:curl-fastapi-bare-rock-end]
    :dedent: 2

The FastAPI app should still respond with
``{"message":"Hello World"}``.

Cleanup
~~~~~~~

And that's it. We can now stop the container and remove the corresponding
image:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:stop-docker-chisel]
    :end-before: [docs:stop-docker-chisel-end]
    :dedent: 2

.. _update-fastapi-application:

Update the FastAPI app
======================

As a final step, let's update our app. For example,
we want to add a new ``/time`` endpoint which returns the current time.

Start by opening the ``app.py`` file in a text editor and update the code to
look like the following:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/time_app.py
    :caption: ~/fastapi-hello-world/app.py
    :language: python

Since we are creating a new version of the app, open the
project file and change the ``version`` (e.g. to ``0.2``).
The top of the ``rockcraft.yaml`` file should look similar to the following:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: ~/fastapi-hello-world/rockcraft.yaml
    :emphasize-lines: 6

    name: fastapi-hello-world
    # see https://documentation.ubuntu.com/rockcraft/en/latest/explanation/bases/
    # for more information about bases and using 'bare' bases for chiselled rocks
    base: bare
    build-base: ubuntu@24.04
    version: '0.2'
    summary: A summary of your FastAPI app # 79 char long summary
    description: |
        This is fastapi project's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
        most important story about it. Keep it under 100 words though,
        we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the
        container registries out there.
    # the platforms this rock should be built on and run on.
    # you can check your architecture with `dpkg --print-architecture`
    platforms:
        amd64:
        # arm64:
        # ppc64el:
        # s390x:

.. note::

    ``rockcraft pack`` will create a new image with the updated code even if we
    don't change the version. It is recommended to change the version whenever
    we make changes to the app in the image.

Pack and run the rock using similar commands as before:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:docker-run-update]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-run-update-end]
    :dedent: 2

.. note::

    Note that the resulting ``.rock`` file will now be named differently, as
    its new version will be part of the filename.

Finally, use ``curl`` to send a request to the ``/time`` endpoint:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:curl-time]
    :end-before: [docs:curl-time-end]
    :dedent: 2

The updated app should respond with the current date and time (e.g.
``{"value":"2024-10-01 06:53:54\n"}``).

.. note::

    If you are getting a ``404`` for the ``/time`` endpoint, check the
    :ref:`troubleshooting-fastapi` steps below.

Cleanup
~~~~~~~

We can now stop the container and remove the corresponding image:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:stop-docker-updated]
    :end-before: [docs:stop-docker-updated-end]
    :dedent: 2

Reset the environment
=====================

We've reached the end of this tutorial.

If we'd like to reset the working environment, we can simply run the
following:

.. literalinclude:: code/fastapi/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:cleanup]
    :end-before: [docs:cleanup-end]
    :dedent: 2

We can also clean the Multipass instance up.
Start by exiting it:

.. code-block:: bash

    exit

And then we can proceed with its deletion:

.. code-block:: bash

    multipass delete rock-dev
    multipass purge

Next steps
==========

Congratulations! You've reached the end of this tutorial. You created a
FastAPI app, packaged it into a rock, and practiced some typical development skills
such as viewing logs and updating the app.

Troubleshooting
===============

**App updates not taking effect?**

Upon changing your FastAPI app and re-packing the rock, if you believe
your changes are not taking effect (e.g. the ``/time``
:ref:`endpoint <update-fastapi-application>` is returning a
404), try running ``rockcraft clean`` and pack the rock again with
``rockcraft pack``.
