Tutorial
========

The tutorials are guided lessons that help you develop skills by using Rockcraft. Each
is self-contained and delivers a working result that marks a learning milestone and is
an opportunity for further exploration. If you're a newcomer to Rockcraft, this is the
best way to start.

The first tutorial works through the process of packaging a rock with Rockcraft. It will
introduce you to key concepts and operations, from installation and setup to finalizing
your first rock.

In the Chisel tutorial, you'll reduce a rock's storage footprint by creating Chisel
slices.

In the 12-factor web app tutorials, you'll assemble containers for 12-factor apps and
their components.
