Tutorial
========

The tutorials are lessons for newcomers to Rockcraft where learning takes place by
working directly with the tool. Each tutorial has a tangible result at the end, so
you'll have confirmation for completing them in something you can keep and revisit
later. They are designed as controlled scenarios, so no prior setup is needed.

The first tutorial is a lesson that works through the main process of packaging a
rock with Rockcraft. It will introduce you to key concepts and operations, starting from
installation and setup and progressing to finalizing your first rock.

In these application tutorials, you'll transform application source code into container
applications:

- :ref:`tutorial-pack-a-python-package`
- :ref:`tutorial-bundle-a-nodejs-app-into-a-rock`

In the Chisel tutorial, you'll reduce a rock's storage footprint by creating Chisel
slices.

:ref:`tutorial-shrink-a-rock-with-chisel`

In the 12-factor web app tutorials, you'll assemble containers for 12-factor apps and
their components.
