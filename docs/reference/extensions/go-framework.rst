go-framework
----------------

The Go extension streamlines the process of building Go application
rocks.

The extension builds and copies the Go binary file to the rock.
By default, the base ``bare`` is used, to generate a lightweight image.


.. note::
    The Go extension is compatible with the ``bare`` and ``ubuntu@24.04``
    bases.

Project requirements
====================

To use the ``go-framework`` extension, there must be a ``go.mod`` file
in the root directory of the project.


``parts`` > ``go-framework/install-app`` > ``organize``
=========================================================

If the main package is in the base directory and the rockcraft name
attribute is equal to the go module name, the name of the binary will
be selected correctly, otherwise you will need to adjust it.

You can use this field to specify a different binary to be used as the
main application, without having to override the service command. For example,
if your Go application contains a ``main`` package in the directory
``cmd/anotherserver``, the name of the binary will be ``anotherserver``
and you can override the main application to use the binary with the
next snippet:

.. code-block:: yaml

  parts:
    go-framework/install-app:
     organize:
       bin/anotherserver: usr/local/bin/<rockcraft project name>


``parts`` > ``go-framework/assets`` > ``stage``
=========================================================


Some files, if they exist in the project root, are included by
default in the rock in the ``/app`` directory.  These include:
``migrate``, ``migrate.sh``, ``templates/`` and ``static/``.

You can customise the files to include by overriding the ``stage`` property
of the ``go-framework/assets`` part:

.. code-block:: yaml

  parts:
    go-framework/assets:
      stage:
        - app/migrate
        - app/migrate.sh
        - app/static
        - app/another_file_or_directory
