Welcome to Rockcraft's documentation!
===========================================


**Rockcraft is a tool to create ROCKs** - a new generation of secure, stable and OCI-compliant container images, powered by Ubuntu.

**Using the same language as Snapcraft and Charmcraft,** Rockcraft (currently under heavy development) offers a true declarative way for building efficient container images. By making use of existing Ubuntu tools like LXD and Multipass,
Rockcraft is able to compartmentalize your typical container image build into multiple parts, each one being comprised of several independent lifecycle steps (pull, build, stage and prime), allowing you to declaratively perform
complex operations, at build time, without the need for massaging or stripping down the build environment from where your final container image originates.

**Off with the cumbersome and explicit scripting, on with the new declarative builds.** While preserving the familiar Ubuntu experience, Rockcraft eliminates the need for imperative builds, allowing everyone to declaratively define
a container image that is built from Ubuntu, for Ubuntu users. Rockcraft implements source-to-image best-practice designs, handling all the repetitive and boilerplate steps of a build and directing your focus to what really
matters - the image's content.

**Rockcraft is for everyone wanting to build production-grade container images,** regardless of their experience as a software developer. From independent software vendors to cloud-native developers and occasional container users.
