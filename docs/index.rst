Welcome to Rockcraft's documentation!
===========================================

**Rockcraft is a tool to create** :ref:`rocks_explanation` -- a new generation
of secure, stable and `OCI-compliant container images <OCI_image_spec_>`_,
based on Ubuntu.

**Rockcraft is for anyone who wants to build production-grade container images,
regardless of their experience as a software developer** -- from independent
software vendors to cloud-native developers and occasional container users.
Rockcraft handles all the repetitive and boilerplate steps of a build,
directing your focus to what really matters: the image's content.

**Using the same language as Snapcraft and Charmcraft, Rockcraft
offers a truly declarative way for building efficient container images.**
By making use of existing Ubuntu tools like LXD_ and Multipass_, Rockcraft
is able to compartmentalise typical container image builds into multiple
parts, each one being comprised of several independent lifecycle steps,
allowing complex operations to be declared at build time.
