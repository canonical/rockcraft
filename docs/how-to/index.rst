How-to guides
*************

If you have a specific goal but are already familiar with Rockcraft, our How-to
guides have more in-depth detail than our tutorials and can be applied to a
broader set of applications.

They'll help you achieve an end result but may require you to understand and
adapt the steps to fit your specific requirements.

Chisel
------

Chisel is a tool that lets you keep only the required files from one or more apt
packages and discard the rest. Upgrade your Chisel slicing skills by learning
how to cut, install and publish slices.
