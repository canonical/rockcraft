How-to guides
=============

These guides accompany you through crafting, chiselling, and publishing rocks with
Rockcraft.


Crafting
--------

The starting point of a rock is a Rockcraft project, which defines what goes into the
rock and what machinery builds it. Once a project is complete, the rock can be packed
either locally or remotely, and then published to an image registry.

Chiselling
----------

Containers often contain redundant or unneeded software in their baseline systems.
Chisel cuts software collections into manageable slices that can layered within rocks to
make them leaner.

12-factor web app rocks
-----------------------

Rocks are especiallys suitable as containers for 12-factor apps and their components.
