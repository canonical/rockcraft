Build a rock for a Flask application
------------------------------------

In this tutorial, we'll create a simple Flask application and learn how to
containerise it in a rock, using Rockcraft's ``flask-framework``
:ref:`extension <flask-framework-reference>`.

Setup
=====

.. include:: /reuse/tutorial/setup_stable.rst

Finally, create a new directory for this tutorial and go inside it:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir flask-hello-world
   cd flask-hello-world

Create the Flask application
============================

Start by creating the "Hello, world" Flask application that we'll use for
this tutorial.

Create a ``requirements.txt`` file, copy the following text into it and then
save it:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/requirements.txt

In order to test the Flask application locally (before packing it into a rock),
install ``python3-venv`` and create a virtual environment:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:create-venv]
    :end-before: [docs:create-venv-end]
    :dedent: 2

In the same directory, copy and save the following into a text file called
``app.py``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/app.py
    :language: python

Run the Flask application using ``flask run -p 8000`` to verify that it works.

Test the Flask application by using ``curl`` to send a request to the root
endpoint. We'll need a new terminal for this -- if we're using Multipass, run
``multipass shell rock-dev`` to get another terminal:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:curl-flask]
    :end-before: [docs:curl-flask-end]
    :dedent: 2

The Flask application should respond with ``Hello, world!``.

The Flask application looks good, so let's stop it for now by pressing
:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`C`.

Pack the Flask application into a rock
======================================

First, we'll need a project file. Rockcraft will automate its
creation and tailoring for a Flask application by using the
``flask-framework`` profile:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:create-rockcraft-yaml]
    :end-before: [docs:create-rockcraft-yaml-end]
    :dedent: 2

The project file will automatically be created in the project's working
directory as ``rockcraft.yaml``. Open it in a text editor and check that the
``name`` is ``flask-hello-world``. Ensure that ``platforms`` includes the host
architecture. For example, if the host uses the ARM architecture, include
``arm64`` in ``platforms``.

.. note::
    For this tutorial, we'll use the ``name`` ``flask-hello-world`` and assume
    we're running on the ``amd64`` platform. Check the architecture of the
    system using ``dpkg --print-architecture``.

    The ``name``, ``version`` and ``platform`` all influence the name of the
    generated ``.rock`` file.

Pack the rock:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:pack]
    :end-before: [docs:pack-end]
    :dedent: 2

.. note::

    Depending on the network, this step can take a couple of minutes to finish.

Once Rockcraft has finished packing the Flask rock, we'll find a new file in
the project's working directory (an `OCI <OCI_image_spec_>`_ archive) with the
``.rock`` extension:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:ls-rock]
    :end-before: [docs:ls-rock-end]
    :dedent: 2

The created rock is about 65MB in size. We will reduce its size later in this
tutorial.

.. note::
    If we changed the ``name`` or ``version`` in the project file or are not
    on an ``amd64`` platform, the name of the ``.rock`` file will be different.

    The size of the rock may vary depending on factors like the architecture
    we're building on and the packages installed at the time of packing.

Run the Flask rock with Docker
==============================

We already have the rock as an `OCI <OCI_image_spec_>`_ archive. Now we
need to load it into Docker:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:skopeo-copy]
    :end-before: [docs:skopeo-copy-end]
    :dedent: 2

Check that the image was successfully loaded into Docker:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:docker-images]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-images-end]
    :dedent: 2

The output should list the Flask container image, along with its tag, ID and
size:

.. terminal::

    REPOSITORY          TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED       SIZE
    flask-hello-world   0.1       c256056698ba   2 weeks ago   149MB

.. note::
    The size of the image reported by Docker is the uncompressed size which is
    larger than the size of the compressed ``.rock`` file.

Now we're finally ready to run the rock and test the containerised Flask
application:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:docker-run]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-run-end]
    :dedent: 2

Use the same ``curl`` command as before to send a request to the Flask
application's root endpoint which is running inside the container:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:curl-flask-rock]
    :end-before: [docs:curl-flask-rock-end]
    :dedent: 2

The Flask application should again respond with ``Hello, world!``.

View the application logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When deploying the Flask rock, we can always get the application logs via
:ref:`pebble_explanation_page`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:get-logs]
    :end-before: [docs:get-logs-end]
    :dedent: 2

As a result, Pebble will give us the logs for the
``flask`` service running inside the container.
We expect to see something similar to this:

.. terminal::

    2024-06-21T03:41:45.077Z [flask] [2024-06-21 03:41:45 +0000] [17] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 22.0.0
    2024-06-21T03:41:45.077Z [flask] [2024-06-21 03:41:45 +0000] [17] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:8000 (17)
    2024-06-21T03:41:45.077Z [flask] [2024-06-21 03:41:45 +0000] [17] [INFO] Using worker: sync
    2024-06-21T03:41:45.078Z [flask] [2024-06-21 03:41:45 +0000] [18] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 18

We can also choose to follow the logs by using the ``-f`` option with the
``pebble logs`` command above. To stop following the logs, press :kbd:`Ctrl` +
:kbd:`C`.

Cleanup
~~~~~~~

Now we have a fully functional rock for a Flask application! This concludes
the first part of this tutorial, so we'll stop the container and remove the
respective image for now:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:stop-docker]
    :end-before: [docs:stop-docker-end]
    :dedent: 2

Chisel the rock
===============

This is an optional but recommended step, especially if we're looking to
deploy the rock into a production environment. With :ref:`chisel_explanation`
we can produce lean and production-ready rocks by getting rid of all the
contents that are not needed for the Flask application to run. This results
in a much smaller rock with a reduced attack surface.

.. note::
    It is recommended to run chiselled images in production. For development,
    we may prefer non-chiselled images as they will include additional
    development tooling (such as for debugging).

The first step towards chiselling the rock is to ensure we are using a
``bare`` :ref:`base <bases_explanation>`.
In the project file, change the ``base`` to ``bare`` and add
``build-base: ubuntu@22.04``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:change-base]
    :end-before: [docs:change-base-end]
    :dedent: 2

.. note::
    The ``sed`` command replaces the current ``base`` in ``rockcraft.yaml`` with
    the ``bare`` base. The command also adds a ``build-base`` which is required
    when using the ``bare`` base.

So that we can compare the size after chiselling, open the project
file and change the ``version`` (e.g. to ``0.1-chiselled``). Pack the rock with
the new ``bare`` :ref:`base <bases_explanation>`:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:chisel-pack]
    :end-before: [docs:chisel-pack-end]
    :dedent: 2

As before, verify that the new rock was created:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:ls-bare-rock]
    :end-before: [docs:ls-bare-rock-end]
    :dedent: 2

We'll verify that the new Flask rock is now approximately **30% smaller**
in size! And that's just because of the simple change of ``base``.

And the functionality is still the same. As before, we can confirm this by
running the rock with Docker

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:docker-run-chisel]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-run-chisel-end]
    :dedent: 2

and then using the same ``curl`` request:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:curl-flask-bare-rock]
    :end-before: [docs:curl-flask-bare-rock-end]
    :dedent: 2

The Flask application should still respond with
``Hello, world!``.

Cleanup
~~~~~~~

And that's it. We can now stop the container and remove the corresponding
image:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:stop-docker-chisel]
    :end-before: [docs:stop-docker-chisel-end]
    :dedent: 2

.. _update-flask-application:

Update the Flask application
============================

As a final step, let's update our application. For example,
we want to add a new ``/time`` endpoint which returns the current time.

Start by opening the ``app.py`` file in a text editor and update the code to
look like the following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/time_app.py
    :language: python

Since we are creating a new version of the application, open the
project file and change the ``version`` (e.g. to ``0.2``).

.. note::

    ``rockcraft pack`` will create a new image with the updated code even if we
    don't change the version. It is recommended to change the version whenever
    we make changes to the application in the image.

Pack and run the rock using similar commands as before:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:docker-run-update]
    :end-before: [docs:docker-run-update-end]
    :dedent: 2

.. note::

    Note that the resulting ``.rock`` file will now be named differently, as
    its new version will be part of the filename.

Finally, use ``curl`` to send a request to the ``/time`` endpoint:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: text
    :start-after: [docs:curl-time]
    :end-before: [docs:curl-time-end]
    :dedent: 2

The updated application should respond with the current date and time (e.g.
``2024-06-21 09:47:56``).

.. note::

    If you are getting a ``404`` for the ``/time`` endpoint, check the
    :ref:`troubleshooting-flask` steps below.

Cleanup
~~~~~~~

We can now stop the container and remove the corresponding image:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:stop-docker-updated]
    :end-before: [docs:stop-docker-updated-end]
    :dedent: 2

Reset the environment
=====================

We've reached the end of this tutorial.

If we'd like to reset the working environment, we can simply run the
following:

.. literalinclude:: ../../code/flask/task.yaml
    :language: bash
    :start-after: [docs:cleanup]
    :end-before: [docs:cleanup-end]
    :dedent: 2

.. collapse:: If using Multipass...

    If we created an instance using Multipass, we can also clean it up.
    Start by exiting it:

    .. code-block:: bash

        exit

    And then we can proceed with its deletion:

    .. code-block:: bash

        multipass delete rock-dev
        multipass purge

.. _troubleshooting-flask:

Troubleshooting
===============

**Application updates not taking effect?**

Upon changing the Flask application and re-packing the rock, if you believe
your changes are not taking effect (e.g. the ``/time``
:ref:`endpoint <update-flask-application>` is returning a
404), try running ``rockcraft clean`` and pack the rock again with
``rockcraft pack``.
