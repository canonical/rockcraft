Prerequisites
-------------

Before starting any of the tutorials, set up a development environment by
following these steps:

* Enable support for snaps on your development system by `installing snapd`_
  and `installing snapcraft`_.
* `Install LXD`_ to manage Linux containers.
* Install Docker_ -- you can install a `Docker snap`_ if you want.

You will also need to use a suitable text editor for simple development tasks.

Since skopeo_ is normally installed as part of the Rockcraft snap,
there is no need to install it separately.
