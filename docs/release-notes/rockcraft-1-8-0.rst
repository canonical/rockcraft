What's new
----------

Rockcraft 1.8.0 brings the following features, integrations, and improvements.

Improved error reporting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We improved the reporting of build-time errors to emphasize the precise cause
of the error. For example, here's the output of ``rockcraft build`` when trying
to compile curl with incorrect build options:

.. terminal::

    Failed to run the build script for part 'curl'.
    Detailed information:
    :: + ./configure
    :: configure: error: select TLS backend(s) or disable TLS with --without-ssl.
    :: Select from these:
    ::   --with-amissl
    ::   --with-bearssl
    ::   --with-gnutls
    ::   --with-mbedtls
    ::   --with-openssl (also works for BoringSSL and LibreSSL)
    ::   --with-rustls
    ::   --with-schannel
    ::   --with-secure-transport
    ::   --with-wolfssl
    ...

uv plugin
~~~~~~~~~

We added a plugin to build Python projects that use `uv`_, a performant package
and project manager. See the :ref:`craft_parts_uv_plugin` reference
for details.

JLink plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~

We added a plugin that uses the `jlink`_ tool to create smaller, optimized
Java runtimes specific for your rock's JARs. See the
:ref:`craft_parts_jlink_plugin` reference for details.

Bash completion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We added a completion file to the Rockcraft snap, which provides command-line
completion of commands and options in Bash-compatible shells. Try it out by
typing ``rockcraft`` and pressing :kbd:`Tab` in your terminal.


Remote build how-to guide
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We published :ref:`outsource-rock-builds-to-launchpad`, a how-to guide for
remote rock builds.
