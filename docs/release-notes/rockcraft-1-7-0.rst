What's new
----------

Rockcraft 1.7.0 brings the following features, integrations, and improvements.


Support for remote builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We added support for remote builds, which leverage off-site compute for
building rocks and can build for multiple architectures with a single command.
For a description of the feature, see :ref:`ref-remote-builds`, or run
``rockcraft remote-build --help``.

This feature is new and experimental -- we welcome feedback on the
`Ubuntu Discourse`_ forum.

Minor features
--------------

Rockcraft 1.7.0 brings the following minor changes.


``init`` command
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default base of the project file generated by ``rockcraft init`` has been
updated from ``ubuntu@22.04`` to ``ubuntu@24.04``.


Rockcraft snap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The base of the Rockcraft snap was updated from core22 to core24.


Go extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new :ref:`tutorial <build-a-rock-for-a-go-application>` and :ref:`reference
<go-framework-reference>` are available for the go-framework extension.


OCI image configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using ``run-user: _daemon_``, the value of the ``Config.User`` key in the
generated rock has been updated from the user name (``_daemon_``) to its
numeric ID.


12-factor app extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We added support for Gunicorn async workers on the Django and Flask extensions.


12-factor app documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation for the various 12-factor framework extensions has been
updated for clarity and to better conform with documentation best practices.


Maven and Ant plugins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We changed the location of the Java runtime executable on rocks built using the
the Maven and Ant plugins from ``/bin/java`` to ``/usr/bin/java``, as the
former conflicts with the user-merged Ubuntu base.

Fixed bugs and issues
---------------------

The following issues have been resolved in Rockcraft 1.7.0:

- `#659`_ Kubernetes ``runAsNonRoot`` incompatibility with
  ``run-user: _daemon_``.
- `#749`_ Trying to build the output of "expand-extensions" fails because of the
  pebble part.
