What's new
----------

Rockcraft 1.11 brings the following features, integrations, and improvements.

Test command
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new command called ``test``, and its accompanying ``init`` profile, are available for
testing rocks. They leverage `Spread`_ to run identically on local and remote systems.

The command is experimental and subject to change. To try it on an existing rock
project, run ``rockcraft init --profile=test`` at the root of your project directory.
For a description of the command and its options, run ``rockcraft test --help``.

Cargo-use plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We added a plugin that sets up a local `cargo registry`_ for `Rust`_ crates. These
crates can then be used by the existing :ref:`Rust plugin <craft_parts_rust_plugin>`.
See the :ref:`craft_parts_cargo_use_plugin` reference for details.

Gradle plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We added a plugin to build sources using the `Gradle`_ build tool. See the
:ref:`craft_parts_gradle_plugin` reference for details.

Minor features
--------------

Rockcraft 1.11 brings the following minor changes.

Support for Maven wrappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Maven plugin now supports the ``maven-use-wrapper`` key to indicate that the build
should use the wrapper provided by the source code. See the
:ref:`craft_parts_maven_plugin` reference for details.
