What's new
----------

Rockcraft 1.15 brings the following features, integrations, and improvements.

Support for interim Ubuntu bases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rockcraft now supports packing rocks built with interim Ubuntu bases, starting with
``ubuntu@25.10``. Since this version of Ubuntu is in development at time of
release, to select this base you must also set ``build-base: devel``.

Improved support for unmaintained bases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you pack rocks with Ubuntu bases that have reached the end of their standard
support, you must now acknowledge that the base is unmaintained. At the time of
release, this affects the ``ubuntu@20.04`` base. Standard support for it ended on
31 May, 2025.

See <LINK TO HOWTO> for instructions on how to pack your rock under these circumstances.

Improved usrmerge support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have made strides in adapting the build process to the usrmerged filesystem commonly
found in Linux distributions, Ubuntu included. Going forward, projects built on base
``ubuntu@25.10`` can handle usrmerge conflicts better, making parts compatible with a
broader share of Debian packages and Chisel slices.

See <LINK TO EXPLANATION> for details on the motivation for the change and ways to
control the behavior on a per-project basis.

New Python plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The behavior of the Python plugin for Rockcraft projects with base ``ubuntu@25.10`` and
higher has been significantly changed to address weaknesses in the previous
implementation. The new plugin is largely compatible with the previous iteration but has
better support for usrmerge.

See <LINK TO REFERENCE> for a description of the behavior of the new plugin. This plugin
is considered experimental while the ``ubuntu@25.10`` base is still in development.

New ``disable-parallel`` key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :ref:`craft_parts_autotools_plugin` now supports the ``disable-parallel`` key to
force builds using the plugin to run using a single job.

Minor features
--------------

Rockcraft 1.15 brings the following minor changes.

Rockcraft project file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimum length of the ``name`` key has been changed from 3 characters to 1.

Lifecycle commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you run a lifecycle command with ``--debug``, Rockcraft will now print the error
before opening a shell into the build environment.

``stage-packages``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed an issue that caused Apt to warn about directory ownership when including
``stage-packages``.

Overlays
~~~~~~~~

- The superfluous message ``unknown argument ignored: lazytime`` that appeared when the
  project includes ``overlay-packages`` or ``overlay-script`` has been removed.
- The detection of collisions between files coming from the overlay and from regular
  builds has been further improved.

Documentation for 12-factor app extensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tutorial and reference pages for all 12-factor app extensions were improved
based on user feedback. Additionally, links to the documentation and to the Matrix
channel have been added to project files generated by the ``init`` command.
