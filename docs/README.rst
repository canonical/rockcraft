Rockcraft documentation guidelines
**********************************

The Rockcraft documentation pages adopt the
`Di√°taxis framework <https://diataxis.fr/>`_.

Contributing to the docs
------------------------

Rockcraft's documentation is generated with Sphinx, and we use reStructuredText
as the markup language for the source files.

Code blocks
***********

All code-like content going into the documentation must be tested, especially if
said content is supposed to be reproducible.

Whenever applicable, sections with code snippets will have their own directory,
with a ``code`` folder within (e.g. ``tutorials/code``).

Each technical page (i.e. a tutorial, a how-to guide, etc.) shall have its own
folder within the ``code`` directory (e.g. ``tutorials/code/hello-world``).

Finally, each page shall have a corresponding ``task.yaml`` file for Spread
tests, and use ``..  literalinclude::`` to include code blocks from those YAML
files.
