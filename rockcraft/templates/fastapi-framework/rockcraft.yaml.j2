    This is fastapi project's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell the
    most important story about it. Keep it under 100 words though,
    we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the
    container registries out there.

# to ensure the FastAPI-framework extension works properly, your FastAPI application
# should have an ASGI entrypoint variable named `app`. This variable has to be defined
# in one of the following places:
#   1. `app.py` file in the base directory
#   2. In any of the following directories, the extension will look for the variable
#      in the files  __init__.py, app.py or main.py:
#     a. `app` directory.
#     b. `src` directory.
#     c. A directory with the same name as the project.
# a `requirements.txt` file with at least the fastapi/starlette package should also
# exist in the base directory.
# see {{versioned_url}}/reference/extensions/fastapi-framework
# for more information.

#       # note: prefix each entry with "app/" followed by the local path.

# you may need Ubuntu packages to build a python dependency. Add them here if necessary.
