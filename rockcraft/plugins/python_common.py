"""Common functionality for Python-based plugins.

This functionality extends Craft-parts' vanilla Python plugin to properly
set the Python interpreter according to the rock's base. Specifically:

- If the base is ubuntu, the venv-created symlinks in bin/ are removed
altogether. This is because of the usrmerge; when the layer is added on
top of the base ubuntu layer bin/ becomes a symlink to usr/bin/, so there
already is a usable Python binary in bin/.
- Since no base (bare or any ubuntu) provides Python by default, the base
interpreter must always be provided by one of the parts. The easiest way
to accomplish this is to add "python3-venv" as a stage-package.
- The shebang in console scripts is hardcoded to "#!/bin/python3". In fact,
every use of Python in the resulting image should be via /bin/python3.
